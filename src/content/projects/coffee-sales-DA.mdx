title: "Coffee Sales Data Analysis & Forecasting"
role: "Data Analyst / Machine Learning Engineer"
year: 2025
duration: "3 weeks"
teamSize: 1
outcomeSummary: "Built an end-to-end analytics and forecasting system that identified top-performing products, seasonal trends, and achieved 94.1% short-term prediction accuracy using Random Forest."
overview: "An exploratory data analysis and machine learning project focused on understanding coffee sales behavior, revenue trends, and predicting future sales using historical transaction data."
problem: "The business lacked clear insights into sales patterns, high-performing products, and future demand, making inventory planning and promotional decisions inefficient."
constraints:
  - "Limited to a single CSV dataset with no external context"
  - "Incomplete card/payment information"
  - "No direct customer identifiers for segmentation"
  - "Time-series data with strong seasonal and weekly patterns"
approach: "Cleaned and engineered features from raw transaction data, performed exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, and evaluated multiple machine learning models to forecast future sales."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "Use rolling averages as core predictive features"
    reasoning: "Recent sales momentum proved to be the strongest indicator of future demand."
    alternatives:
      - "Using only raw daily sales"
      - "Relying solely on calendar-based features"
      - "Manual seasonal decomposition"
  - decision: "Select Random Forest as the final model"
    reasoning: "It outperformed linear models by capturing non-linear weekly and seasonal patterns."
    alternatives:
      - "Linear Regression"
      - "Ridge Regression"
      - "Gradient Boosting"
techStack:
  - "Python"
  - "pandas"
  - "NumPy"
  - "Matplotlib"
  - "Seaborn"
  - "Scikit-learn"
  - "Jupyter Notebook"
impact:
  metrics:
    - label: "Forecast Accuracy (Last Week)"
      value: "94.1%"
    - label: "R² Score"
      value: "0.56"
    - label: "Mean Absolute Error"
      value: "2.95 sales"
  qualitative: "Provided actionable insights into product performance and seasonal demand, enabling more informed inventory planning and marketing decisions."
learnings:
  - "Feature engineering has a larger impact than model complexity in time-series forecasting"
  - "Non-linear models are better suited for real-world sales patterns"
  - "Visualization is critical for communicating analytical insights to non-technical stakeholders"
